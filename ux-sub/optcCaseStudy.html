                <h3><u><b>Who is LIFE Church of West LA?</b></u></h3>
                <br>
                <p>LIFE Church is a small church located near the edge of Culver City, CA with a congregation of about 30
                    members. The congregation is dedicated to serving and sharing with the greater Los Angeles area through
                    individual initiatives or partnerships with other churches.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Members of LIFE Church agree that the small congregation allows for a family feel with a warm atmosphere. The congregation spends a lot of time together outside of Sunday services. </p>

        <h3 class="sectionHead"><b>USER RESEARCH:</b></h3>
        <br>
        <p>To begin this project, I decided to research the main motivations for attending a church and what people look for in
            churches. Seeking a church is a highly personal journey and therefore a "one size fits all" approach does not exist.
            Through a combination of survey data, user interviews, and ancillary research; we were able to pull some useful
            insights.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead"><b>Survey data:</b></h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Research began by deploying an initial survey to understand how people who identify as Christian would approach a
            search for a new home church. From a pool of 20 respondents, beliefs and statement of faith was almost unanimously
            agreed to be the main factor. Congregation size and demographics came as the next most considered factor with nearly
            half of all respondents. Factors such as resources, bible studies, or mission work interestingly did not index as
            high.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4 class="sectionSubHead"><b>User Interviews:</b></h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            For qualitative data, I conducted four user interviews. I felt it was important to get perspective from both those who identify as Christian as well as those who do not and so chose two interviewees who did not identify as Christian. Although I expected different criteria from these groups, there was consensus on what was desired when attending church.

        <ul>
            <li>For someone who identifies as Christian, a church must have a sound statement of faith. If the doctrine and beliefs are not biblical, this is likely to raise a red flag.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Even if a church has great resources and sermons, a visitor is not likely to come again if they do not feel welcomed or feel they do not fit in with the congregation culture.</li>

                    needs to find a new home church. He's already familiar with some of the larger churches in LA, but he's looking for
                    a smaller congregation so he can build meaningful relationships and service the local community. Robert also has a
                    6-year-old daughter so he wants to find a church with a good children's program.

        <br>
        <p>Working with my partner, we began sketching a new layout for the LIFE church site landing page. We agreed the landing
            page should have easy access to information regarding Sunday service logistics, but also information on the church,
            the pastor, and the small groups. We also decided to make the experience scroll based so that the user could take in more information without navigating too deep within the site.</p>

                <p>
                    After taking components from both of our sketches, we moved into our lo-fi wireframe. When prioritizing information,
                    we figured the user would want to know what this church looks like so we placed a jumbotron that would have an image
                    of the congregation. The user would want to know more about this church and so we placed a short description of the
                    church as well as a bio of the pastor. <br><br> After gaining a sense of this church, perhaps the user would be mroe curious
                    about ways they could get involved in the church so we included a section where users could read about the different
                    groups and access those pages if they wanted to learn more. We placed the Sunday service information at the bottom
                    as the user would ideally have made a decision to visit by the time they reached the bottom of the page. If they had
                    questions we put in a question form as well.

                    existing color pallet of the site, we began applying colored backgrounds taking inspiration from Design 3.0 layouts
                    we had seen during research. When we tested this version, however, we quickly realized we had been making UI choices
                    without intent. The green backgrounds were taking away from the content and were mostly there for pure aesthetic
                    purposes. After realizing this, we decided to take a step back and go for a simpler layout.

We decided to take another step back and review how we might solve the issue. So, we went back into prototyping with Figma to come up with a new layout.

            In the end, we learned that it's sometimes better to take a step back and take a simpler approach. While we were not
            able to plan out the full site in the two-week duration of this project. We would like to continue working on the
            site and pitch our ideas to LIFE Church.
